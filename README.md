# ✈️ Flight Prediction System – NUS AD Project (Team 2)

This is the official repository for our NUS AD (Application Development) Capstone Project: **Flight Prediction based on Machine Learning**, developed by Team 2.

We aim to empower travellers with predictive tools that help them make smarter decisions around air travel — including predicting ticket prices, delay risks, and recommending optimal flight combinations.
